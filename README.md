# 💎 DiamondHacks 2025 – Building UIs in React/Next.js

Welcome to the official starter project for the **DiamondHacks 2025 workshop** on React and Next.js! 🎉

This is a simple Next.js project bootstrapped using [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app), designed to help you get hands-on experience with modern web development.

Whether you're brand new to web dev or just looking to sharpen your skills, this repo will guide you through building a fast, dynamic site using **React + Next.js**.

## ✏️ Start Editing

The main page of this app lives in:

```

You can edit this file to start building your project. Changes update in real-time, so no need to refresh the page!

This starter also uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to load the **Inter** font automatically.
